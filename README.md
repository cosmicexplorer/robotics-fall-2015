==================

A project by [Martin Bramlett](https://github.com/bramlemk) and [Danny McClanahan](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer).

[Arduino code](arduino/keyboard) is available, and can be run by uploading the [keyboard.ino sketch](arduino/keyboard/keyboard.ino) to most Arduino devices. We used a Duemilanove, but it shouldn't affect anything if you use something else.

To run the robot code, run the command:

``` shell
rosrun pianist demo3.py
```
